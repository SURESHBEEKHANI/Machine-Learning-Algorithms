#  Machine Learning Regression Algorithms
Regression algorithms predict continuous outcomes based on input features. Key algorithms include:

Linear Regression: Models relationships with a linear equation.

Polynomial Regression: Uses polynomial equations for nonlinear relationships.

Ridge Regression: Adds regularization to linear regression to prevent overfitting.

Lasso Regression: Uses L1 regularization for feature selection.

Elastic Net Regression: Combines ridge and lasso penalties for correlated features.

Support Vector Regression (SVR): Applies SVM principles for regression tasks.

Decision Tree Regression: Uses tree structures to make continuous predictions.

Random Forest Regression: Combines multiple decision trees to enhance accuracy.

Gradient Boosting Regression: Sequentially builds models to correct previous errors.

XGBoost: An optimized gradient boosting algorithm for speed and performance.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): Learns complex patterns through layered neurons.

Bayesian Regression: Uses Bayesian methods for probabilistic predictions.

Each algorithm has unique strengths, making them suitable for different types of regression tasks based on the dataset and problem requirements.
